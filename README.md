# Data Manipulation and Creating Dashboards in Excel

In this project, I take data from a fictional coffee company and use it to create a dashboard for easy visualization of the data.

The raw data comes from three Excel files:
- coffeeOrders
- coffeeCustomers
- coffeeProducts

To complete this task, I took the following steps:

## Merging, Cleaning, and Manipulating the Data

1. Moved all of the data from each individual workbook into a single workbook.
2. Formatted each dataset into a table for easy referencing in Excel formulas.
3. Utilized XLOOKUP and Index/Match to create additional columns in the Orders table to include the customer and product details of each order.
4. Utilized nested IF formulas to create columns that list the full names of the Coffee and Roast types for clarity.
5. Converted dates to include written month to prevent confusion between date formats.
6. Utilized "Remove Duplicates" to ensure there was no duplicate data in the table.

## Creating the Pivot Tables and Dashboard
1. Created pivot tables for the various information that I want displayed on the dashboard.
2. Created pivot charts for each pivot table.
3. Created splicers for the data that I would like to be able to filter.
4. Used the built-in shapes and styles for the design of the dashboard.

To view the dashboard, download by clicking on the CoffeeDashboardPortfolio.xlsx file and then clicking on "View RAW".

To view the raw data before cleaning/manipulation, do the same with the coffeeOrders, coffeeCustomers, and coffeeProducts files.
